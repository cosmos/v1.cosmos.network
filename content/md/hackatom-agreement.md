All Participants, ICF and partners acknowledge that any ideas created during the Hackathon will have no exclusive ownership. Each Participant is free to separately commercialise and exploit each idea and create Products from the Ideas. Notwithstanding, any intellectual property created during the Hackathon will remain solely with the Participant(s).

3.  Not violate the intellectual property rights or other rights including but not limited to copyright, trademark, patent, contract, and/or privacy rights, of any other person or entity.

A Participant may use third party hardware or software to create the Submission provided the Participant complies with all third party licensing requirements and the Submission components are solely the Participant’s work product and the result of the Participant’s ideas and creativity, and the Participant owns all rights to them.

A Participant may submit a Submission that includes the use of Open Source Software or hardware as defined below, provided the Participant complies with the requirements of this section. By entering the Hackathon you represent, warrant, and agree that your Submission meets these requirements.

"Open Source Software" means any software code that is distributed as "open source software" or "freeware" or is otherwise distributed publicly or made generally available in source code form under terms that permit modification and redistribution of such software on the condition that if such software code is redistributed that it be (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) distributed at no charge, including but not limited to, software licensed or distributed under any of the collection of Open Source Initiative ("OSI") approved licenses.

## Commercialising Ideas

If Participant comes up with something that is commercially interesting, we'd like to be able to promote you, the team and your idea widely. We will obtain your permission to do so and you can opt out.

## Business Relationship

The intent of the Hackathon is to encourage people to suggest their ideas and innovations to ICF and our technology partners. Participation in this Hackathon does not create an obligation on either Participant(s) part or part of ICF/Hackathon partners to negotiate or enter into any business relationship or to sign any commercial agreement.

## Judging

The Hackathon winners will be chosen from the teams of Participants by a panel of judges. The judges’ decisions are final, binding and incontestable.

ICF is not responsible for any dispute among teams or team Participants related to prizes. Participant is solely responsible for any applicable taxes for any prize.

All prize payments will be made within a reasonable timeframe to only one nominated payment modality per prize, to be negotiated prior to payment with selected winners.

## Publicity and Privacy
